To solve the issue, ensure your Tailwind configuration includes the component's file:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Also, check for CSS conflicts. If other CSS rules are overriding Tailwind's classes, use the `!important` flag as a last resort (not recommended for production). 

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 !important">My Component</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 !important">This is some content.</p>
</div>
```

Another solution could involve restarting your development server or rebuilding your application.
