# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied to a component, even though they are correctly specified in the HTML.

## Bug Description
A simple component is created using Tailwind CSS classes. However, the classes do not seem to be applied to the component, resulting in no styling being applied.  This could be due to several reasons, including CSS conflicts, an incorrect Tailwind CSS configuration, or a problem with the build process.

## Solution
The solution might involve checking for CSS conflicts (e.g., another CSS file overriding Tailwind CSS styles), ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correct (e.g., `tailwind.config.js` is properly configured and the `content` array includes the relevant files), and verifying that the component is properly included in the build process.  One potential solution involves adding the `!important` flag to the Tailwind styles (though this is generally not recommended and is used here only for demonstration).
