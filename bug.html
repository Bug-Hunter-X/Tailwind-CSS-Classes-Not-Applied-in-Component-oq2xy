The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly in the component:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">My Component</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This is some content.</p>
</div>
```

The issue is that the component appears with no styling, despite having Tailwind CSS classes assigned. This might happen if there's a conflict with other CSS, incorrect Tailwind CSS configuration, or if the component is not properly included in the Tailwind CSS build process.
